# Agentic Farm Intelligence - AR System

This prototype turns a Streamlit app into an "agentic augmented reality" lens:
you open it on an iPhone (or any device with a camera), give camera permission,
and it draws small squares (bounding boxes) around detected objects with an
intelligent pop-up caption above them.
